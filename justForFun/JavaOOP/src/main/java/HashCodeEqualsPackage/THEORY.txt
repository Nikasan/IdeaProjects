Primitive data types: ==

Non-primitive, objects:

== compares references, it checks if the object is equal to itself;
equals() performs the '==' operation under the hood, that's why this method must be overridden for class


hashCode() - 32-bit value of the int type;
If two objects are equal (i.e. the equals() method returns true), they must have the same hashcode.
If the hashCode() method is called multiple times on the same object, it must return the same result every time.
